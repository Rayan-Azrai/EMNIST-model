# EMNIST-model
This project trains a neural network model using PyTorch to classify handwritten characters from the EMNIST dataset. The model consists of multiple fully connected layers with LeakyReLU activations. The repository includes code for data loading, training, evaluation, and visualization (loss curves, confusion matrix, and classification report).
